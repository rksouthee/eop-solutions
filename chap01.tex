\begin{lemma}
	If a value type is uniquely represented, equality implies representational equality.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
	Let $T$ be a value type that is uniquely represented. We are going to assume equality,
	then we shall prove representational equality. If two values represent the same abstract entity,
	they must have the same value since $T$ is uniquely represented. If the values are the same, the datums
	are identical sequences of 0s and 1s, that is, they are representationally equal.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
	If a value type is not ambiguous, representational equality implies equality.
\end{lemma}
