\chapter{Coordinates with Mutable Successors}

\begin{lemma}
	For each of the ranges $[h, t]$ returned by \verb|split_linked|, $h = l \Leftrightarrow t = l$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{exercise}
	Assuming that one of the ranges $(h, t)$ returned by \verb|split_linked| is not empty, explain what
	iterator $t$ points to and what the value of $\func{successor}(t)$ is.
\end{exercise}
